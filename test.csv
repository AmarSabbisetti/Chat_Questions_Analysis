By job-specific, I mean that there are some jobs that are more high-touch in nature and require in-person connection, where as other jobs in this digital age are fine to do mostly if not completely from home. Maintaining productivity and client service levels is also a key factor. I would also use in-person events as a way to extend community and engagement, but not be required.
